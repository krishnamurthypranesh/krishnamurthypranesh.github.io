> _"_ **Don't think about what's easy. Think about what's fun** _"_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Bokuto Kotaro (Haikyuu)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one really hits it home for me. I love this so much that I got a [tattoo](/images/fun_greater_easy.jpg) to constantly remind me of this.
