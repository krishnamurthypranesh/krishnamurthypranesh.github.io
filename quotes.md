&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Tim Ferriss, Tools of Titans

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the first thing that should be put on every book, presentation, and anything that people read. In today's hyperactive culture, this phrase is gold. Read the book.

Just because you have a fancy title doesn't mean you love what you do. And, just because you don't have a fancy title doesn't mean you're fake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Kiryuu Wakatsu, Mujinazaka Volleyball Team's "Ace"
