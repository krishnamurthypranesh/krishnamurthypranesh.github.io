### Working on the Blog
I'm working on the bits and pieces of the blog. Trying out a lot of things before I make a single push.


### Rust
I've been wanting to learn a new programming language for a while now. In this process, I've dabbled in Nim, Go, Javascript, C++ and a few others. Nim has no direction yet. Go is just like python, but is statically compiled. Javascript is python in the browser. And, C++, well it's 2020. Rust seemed to be a really good option. I strongly feel that learning Rust will take my programming game up a step. So, here we are.

I'm going through the resources offered on the official website.
