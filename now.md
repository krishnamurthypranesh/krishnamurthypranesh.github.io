# Adapting to life in Germany
I recently moved to Germany and am slowly adapting to life here. Its nice. Totally different compared to how I've lived in Bengaluru.

# Tools for myself
I'm finding myself imagining all sorts of tools to build for myself these days.

Especially now that I've got linux machine all for myself. I'm still on Ubuntu. I want to move to Arch. But, I still think there's a lot to understand before I make the big move (also, I'm too lazy to install Arch).

# Setting up Neovim and learning lua
I'm slowly getting the hang of truly customizing neovim. I'm no where near the level of ThePrimeagen and others like him. But, I'm slowly and surely writing smaller lua scripts to improve my own neovim workflow.

# Reading
## Exercise Science and Biomechanics
I've bought a bunch of books on exercise science, biomechanics and energy systems. The idea is to learn things properly and then apply them to my own training. No more copying programmes from the internet and running through them without any goal.

## Postgres Internals
I started reading this book because I feel the need to understand the internals of postgres better for work. Its amazing so far.

## The Wheel of Time: Book #3
I'm finally feeling like reading the 3rd book in the series.

# Watches
I'm slowly, but surely building a watch collection for myself. Its getting there.
