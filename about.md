A timeline will provide very little context I guess. This might change in the future.

I was born in 1996. So, I'm about 24 years old. I'm a software developer by hobby and by profession.

### I love physical activity.
This is one of those things which I can't ever get enough of.

### I LOVE ANIME. 
It's one of those things which keeps me really sane. I'm very selective about the stuff I watch. But, I love everything I watch.

### I like to read
I'm a sucker for fantasy. High fantasy, dragons. Yep. Stuff like that. Dystopian stuff. Just let me have it.

### I'm lazy and ambitious 
I waste a lot of time. Which is why I'm stuck on completing things as soon as possible. I like to dive deep into something. 

### I like to experiment
One of the thoughts driving my actions is this: Experiment. Gather data. Evaluate results. Rinse and repeat. The scientific method has sort of become the decision making framework driving all the big things in my life.

### I like figuring out how stuff works
The meaning behind the Navier-Stokes equation? Why are TCP connections better than UDP connections? Why did Katappa kill Bahubali? Stuff like that.

### I love being alone
I'm not an ideal introvert. But, I do enjoy long periods of time alone. It's roughly a 7:3 ratio. If I spend 3 hours in the company of people, I won't feel complete if I don't spend 7 hours alone.

### At the end of the day, it's the problems
I won't lie. I'd rather solve the Navier-Stokes equation than global warming. Simply because I find the former more interesting. I'm here to learn and solve interesting problems. That's that.

### My work
I've gotten a lot of things wrong in my twenty-something life. But, this is one of those things which I'm genuinely happy about. I love what I do. Writing code and building things are hobbies first and jobs second. So, even if I made enough money that I wouldn't have to work for the rest of my life, I'd still be writing software.

That said, I'm a professional(#TheWarOfArt)
