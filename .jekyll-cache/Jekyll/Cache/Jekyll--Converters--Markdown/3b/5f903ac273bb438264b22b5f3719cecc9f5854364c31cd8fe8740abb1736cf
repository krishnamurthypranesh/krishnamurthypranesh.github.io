<p>A timeline will provide very little context I guess. This might change in the future.</p>

<p>I was born in 1996. So, I’m about 24 years old. I’m a software developer by hobby and by profession.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-physical-activity">I love physical activity.</h3>
<p>This is one of those things which I can’t ever get enough of.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-anime">I LOVE ANIME.</h3>
<p>It’s one of those things which keeps me really sane. I’m very selective about the stuff I watch. But, I love everything I watch.</p>

<h3 id="i-like-to-read">I like to read</h3>
<p>I’m a sucker for fantasy. High fantasy, dragons. Yep. Stuff like that. Dystopian stuff. Just let me have it.</p>

<h3 id="im-lazy-and-ambitious">I’m lazy and ambitious</h3>
<p>I waste a lot of time. Which is why I’m stuck on completing things as soon as possible. I like to dive deep into something.</p>

<h3 id="i-like-to-experiment">I like to experiment</h3>
<p>One of the thoughts driving my actions is this: Experiment. Gather data. Evaluate results. Rinse and repeat. The scientific method has sort of become the decision making framework driving all the big things in my life.</p>

<h3 id="i-like-figuring-out-how-stuff-works">I like figuring out how stuff works</h3>
<p>The meaning behind the Navier-Stokes equation? Why are TCP connections better than UDP connections? Why did Katappa kill Bahubali? Stuff like that.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-being-alone">I love being alone</h3>
<p>I’m not an ideal introvert. But, I do enjoy long periods of time alone. It’s roughly a 7:3 ratio. If I spend 3 hours in the company of people, I won’t feel complete if I don’t spend 7 hours alone.</p>

<h3 id="at-the-end-of-the-day-its-the-problems">At the end of the day, it’s the problems</h3>
<p>I won’t lie. I’d rather solve the Navier-Stokes equation than global warming. Simply because I find the former more interesting. I’m here to learn and solve interesting problems. That’s that.</p>

<h3 id="my-work">My work</h3>
<p>I’ve gotten a lot of things wrong in my twenty-something life. But, this is one of those things which I’m genuinely happy about. I love what I do. Writing code and building things are hobbies first and jobs second. So, even if I made enough money that I wouldn’t have to work for the rest of my life, I’d still be writing software.</p>

<p>That said, I’m a professional(#TheWarOfArt) I’m here to learn and solve interesting problems. That’s that.</p>
